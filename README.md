# Movie-Recommendation-Engine
tmdb-movie-dataset-analysis is an report for analyzing the TMDB movie data containing information about 50000 movies from The Movie Database (TMDB). Firstly, the report raises some questions based on the dataset needed to be researched. 
1. We will perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in "MovieDatasetAnalysis.ipynb" notebook to find the insight according to the research questions and will draw the conclusion to illustrate these insights.
2. We will clean the data like remove missing, duplicates, punctuations etc in  "Preprocessing.ipynb" notebook.
3. We will create a NLP model using Cosine-Similarity to recommend top 5 movies to a user based on their previous watch history.
4. Wil create an interactive web app using streamlitit app.
 
The tools used in this report are Python libraries - numpy, pandas, and matplotlib, pycharm, streamlit, tmdb api. The Jupyter notebook is used to illustrate the interactive analysis.
